For those who don't know, ABBA rules caving is a competitive caving minigame made popular by the Mindcrack server. Typically a round lasts 20 minutes, and whoever has the highest score at the end takes home all the loot.

This plugin lets you run a game of ABBA rules caving without needing a separate timer, and being able to see your opponents' scores adds a bit of extra competitive pressure.

## The scoring
* Redstone Ore - 1 point
* Lapis Ore - 1 point
* Gold Ore - 3 points
* Diamond Ore - 5 points
* Emerald Ore - 7 points
